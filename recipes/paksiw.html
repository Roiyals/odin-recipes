    <h2>Filipino fish stew</h2>

    <p>
      Paksiw is a traditional Filipino dish where meat, often pork or fish, is
      simmered in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and various spices. The dish is
      characterized by its tangy, savory, and slightly sweet flavor, with the
      vinegar acting as a tenderizer and adding depth to the taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paksiw is typically served with rice and can include ingredients like
      vegetables or banana blossoms, depending on the variation. It's a
      comforting, flavorful dish that is popular in Filipino home cooking.
