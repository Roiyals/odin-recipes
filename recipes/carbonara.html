    <h2>Creamy pasta with eggs and pancetta</h2>

    <p>
      Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with a creamy sauce of
      eggs, cheese, pancetta or bacon, and black pepper. The sauce is made by
      tossing the hot pasta with the egg mixture, allowing the heat to create a
      silky, smooth coating. The dish is rich and flavorful, with the crispy
      pancetta adding texture and the cheese providing a savory, tangy depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's traditionally served with spaghetti, but other pasta types can be
      used as well. Carbonara is beloved for its simple ingredients and
      comforting, indulgent taste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti</li>
      <li>100g (3.5 oz) pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (if using garlic)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.
        Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat and cook
        pancetta or bacon until crispy. If using garlic, add it to the pan and
        cook for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino, and a pinch of black
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once pasta is cooked, toss it with the pancetta (off the heat), then add
        the egg mixture, stirring quickly to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved
        pasta water as needed to reach desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, topped with extra cheese and black pepper. Enjoy!
